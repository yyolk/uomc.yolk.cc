Intended Recipient: Jason Calacanis

Required:
--

- a video camera
- a video sharing site account (YouTube, MegaVideo, vimeo, etc.)

Procedure
---

1. Turn on video camera and fit face into full frame. 
  - The goal is to have your face inside this shot at all times so facial expressions are captured.
2. Declaration.
   - declare your name and anything else you would like to communicate verbally as long as:
     - you are honest
     - the declaration is under a minute (the same time as my "communique")
3. While video camera is still recording, watch video communique from *YOLK*
   - when video finishes return here and complete step 4
4. STARE into the camera for 5 - 10 seconds. 
   - IMPORTANT: While thinking about what you just saw communicate without words.
5. END video recording and upload to preferred video sharing service.
   - you may use any privacy setting you wish, but understand that if the link to this video is not sent to the secret email link sent to intended participant in the form of the initial invitation, the entire piece will die and the attempt at abstract communication will fail.

_Thank you for your consideration_
